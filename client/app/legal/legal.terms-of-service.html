      	<p>Terms of Service (Effective [●]/12/15)</p>
        <h2>InvestNextDoor Terms of Service</h2>
        <h2></h2>
        <p>INVESTNEXTDOOR INCORPORATED (“IND”, “we”, “us”, “our” or the “Company”) operates the website located at www.investnextdoor.ca (the “<strong>Site</strong>”).&nbsp; We are an online general solicitation and private issuer marketplace, designed to facilitate the solicitation of private capital security offerings which may help close the gap in investment in small businesses across Canada (each a “<strong>Business</strong>”), using a community-centric marketing program..</p>
        <h3>1.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acceptance of the Terms of Service; Changes</h3>
        <p>By using the Site or accessing any of the services provided on or through the Site (“<strong>Services</strong>”), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (the “<strong>TOS</strong>”).&nbsp; IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT AND AGREE TO ALL OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE TOS, YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO ACCESS THE SITE OR USE THE SERVICES.</p>
        <p>As used in the TOS, the terms “you” and “your” mean each individual or entity that accesses, browses or uses the Site and/or the Services in any manner.&nbsp; If you are accessing the Site and/or using the Services on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant to IND that you satisfy the Eligibility criteria in Section 3 below and that you have the authority to bind the entity you represent to the TOS.&nbsp; Your agreement to these terms will be treated as the agreement of the entity you represent.</p>
        <p>IND may modify the TOS or add or remove terms at any time, and each such modification, addition or deletion will be effective immediately upon posting on the Site.&nbsp; Your use of the Site or the Services following any such posted modification, addition or deletion constitutes your agreement to be bound by and your acceptance of the TOS as so modified.&nbsp; It is therefore important that you review the TOS regularly.&nbsp; IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THE TERMS OF THE MODIFIED TOS, YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO ACCESS THE SITE AND/OR USE THE SERVICES, AND YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY DISCONTINUE DOING SO.</p>
        <h3>2.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Privacy Policy; Additional Terms</h3>
        <p>Use of the Site and the Services is subject to the InvestNextDoor Privacy Policy (the “<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>”).&nbsp; The terms of the Privacy Policy are incorporated into the TOS by this reference.&nbsp; (To view the Privacy Policy, click here.)</p>
        <p>Your access to and/or use of certain portions of the Site and certain of the Services will require you to accept terms and conditions applicable to such Services which are in addition to the terms of the TOS and will be presented to you for your acceptance when you sign up for such Services (the “<strong>Additional</strong> <strong>Terms</strong>”).&nbsp; If you are an Investor (as defined below), you also agree to the attached IND Prospective Investor Agreement and if you are a Business, you also agree to the attached IND Business Agreement. The IND Prospective Investor Agreement and the IND Business Agreement are part of the Additional Terms. The TOS, the Privacy Policy and the Additional Terms (collectively, the “<strong>User Agreements</strong>”) set forth the terms and conditions that apply to your use of the Site and the Services.&nbsp; To the extent there is any conflict between the TOS and any Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will prevail.</p>
        <h3>3.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eligibility</h3>
        <p>You may only use the Site and the Services if you are either a legitimate Business operating in Canada and, an “accredited investor” (“<strong>Investor</strong>”) as defined in National Instrument 45-106 <em>Prospectus Exemptions</em> <em>. </em>Each Business is obligated to satisfy itself that each investor meets the qualifications of being an “accredited investor” prior to selling securities to them. However, IND will, at the time when an Investor is ready to invest and transmit funds to escrow or a FBO account, have the qualifications of each Investor reviewed by a third-party provider to complete an initial assurance of the status of each Investor as an “accredited investor”. If IND is not reasonably assured by the third party, it reserves the right to refuse the Investor to proceed. An investor who is denied access may petition the prospective issuer to have their status reviewed (at their own expense) by another reputable third-party service provider and, if reasonable assurance is provided to and accepted by the issuer, then the Investor may continue to participate in the offering, subject to the final determination by the Business. As noted above, we will require both businesses and prospective investors to provide information to us so that we can assess their qualifications to use the Site, but each Business will need to determine whether it and the prospective investors meet all applicable securities laws and other requirements.&nbsp; We reserve the right to alter eligibility to participate in our site at our discretion and any amendments will be made to the Terms of Service (TOS).</p>

        <p>Businesses may sell their securities by use of so-called Dutch auctions or modified Dutch auctions. These auctions typically allow potential prospective investors the ability to bid on what they are willing to accept as an interest rate on a note (or to pay for a security), and the Business determines which bids to accept. Each Business will indicate the information for purchasing the securities it is offering through IND, including any applicable bidding procedures. Before offering to purchase a security from a Business, Prospective investors should review each all available information carefully.</p>

        <h4>15.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Dispute Resolution</u></h4>
        <p>15.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Arbitration</em>.&nbsp; Subject to the other provisions of this Section 15.3, all disputes with respect to any claim for indemnification and all other disputes and controversies of every kind and nature between you and IND arising out of or in connection with use of the Site or the Services or the User Agreements shall be submitted to individual party arbitration pursuant to the following procedures:</p>
        <p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a dispute or controversy arises, either party may, in a written notice delivered to the other party, demand such arbitration.&nbsp; Such notice shall provide a statement of the matter in controversy;</p>
        <p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event the parties cannot resolve the matter within thirty (30) days after receipt of such demand, either party may file a notice of arbitration with the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>“).&nbsp; The arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules (collectively the “<strong>AAA Rules</strong>”), as modified by the User Agreements, and will be administered by the AAA.&nbsp; The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.&nbsp; A single arbitrator experienced in commercial matters shall be chosen by the AAA as the single arbitrator of the dispute. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this TOS and the arbitrator shall decide all issues, except the issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration, which are for a court to decide.&nbsp; In all cases, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which any award is based;</p>
        <p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your claim is for less than $5,000, IND shall reimburse you for the filing fee and shall pay the cost of the arbitrator, with you being responsible for your own legal and expert expenses.&nbsp; If the your claim is for $5,000 or more, the filing fees and costs shall be payable in accordance with AAA Rules;</p>
        <p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless you and IND otherwise agree, any arbitration hearings will take place in Ontario, Canada.&nbsp; If your claim is for less than $5,000, IND agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by in-person hearing as established by AAA Rules;</p>
        <p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An award rendered by the arbitrator appointed pursuant to this Agreement shall be final and binding on all parties to the proceeding, shall deal with the question of costs of the arbitration and all related matters, shall not award punitive damages, and judgment on such award may be entered by either party in a court of competent jurisdiction;</p>
        <p>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BOTH YOU AND IND AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR AND IND’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and IND agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not preside over any form of representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirely of this arbitration provision shall be null and void; and</p>
        <p>(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The arbitration provisions hereof shall, with respect to such controversy or dispute, survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.</p>
        <p>15.3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Emergency Relief</em>.&nbsp; Notwithstanding anything in this Section 15.3.1 to the contrary, either party may seek from a court any provisional remedy that may be necessary to protect any rights or property of such party pending the establishment of the arbitral tribunal or its determination of the merits of the controversy.</p>
        <p>15.3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Jurisdiction and Venue; Waiver of Jury</em>. &nbsp;Subject to Section 15.3.1, you and IND agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in the Province of Ontario to resolve any dispute arising out of the User Agreements or your access to or use of the Site or the Services.&nbsp; EACH OF YOU AND IND HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY CLAIMS, COUNTERCLAIMS, CROSS-CLAIMS, OR THIRD PARTY CLAIMS) ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT.&nbsp; FURTHER, EACH OF YOU AND IND HEREBY CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OR AGENT OF THE OTHER HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT THE OTHER WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF SUCH LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THIS WAIVER OF RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL PROVISION.&nbsp; EACH OF YOU AND IND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS SECTION IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR EACH OF THEM, RESPECTIVELY, TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT.</p>
        <h3>16.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indemnity</h3>
        <p>You agree to defend IND, its subsidiaries, affiliates, licensors and assignees and their respective officers, directors, managers, stockholders, agents, partners and employees (the “<strong>IND Indemnitees</strong>”), from and against any and all claims, actions, suits, demands or other proceedings brought by or on behalf of any third party, and to indemnify and hold the IND Indemnitees harmless against any losses, liabilities and other damages (including, but not limited to, reasonable legal and expert fees and court costs), in any case arising out of or related to (i) your access to and/or use of the Site and the Services, including, without limitation, your use of the Site and the Services in connection with any transaction in securities; (ii) a violation or breach by you, or any user of your account, of any provision of the TOS or other User Agreement, including, without limitation, a breach of any of the representations, warranties or agreements set forth in the TOS and the Additional Terms; and/or (iii) any content that you post on or through the Site or the Services.&nbsp; This defense and indemnification obligation will survive following the termination of your use of the Site and the Services.</p>
        <h3>17.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other Terms</h3>
        <p>IND has the right to assign the User Agreements and/or its rights thereunder, in whole or in part, to any third party.&nbsp; You do not have the right to assign the User Agreements, except if and to the extent explicitly permitted in the Additional Terms.&nbsp; The failure of IND to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the User Agreements shall not operate as a waiver by IND of such right or provision.&nbsp; The section titles in the User Agreements are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.&nbsp; The User Agreements operate to the fullest extent permissible by law.&nbsp; If any provision of the User Agreements is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, such provision (i) is deemed severable from the User Agreements and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions which shall remain in full force and effect and (ii) shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary to comply with the applicable law.&nbsp; IND reserves all rights in and to the Site, including the Services and the other content posted thereon, unless otherwise expressly provided by this TOS or the Additional Terms.&nbsp; IND reserves the right to modify or discontinue any aspect of the Services at any time without prior notice and without any liability to you.</p>
