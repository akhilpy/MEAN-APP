    		<h2>InvestNextDoor Canada Privacy Policy (Effective December 4 2015)</h2>
        <p>We have a few fundamental principles:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, allow you to transact business on the Website, develop our products and services, or protect our rights.</li>
        <li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our products and services.</li>
        <li>We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Below is our Privacy Policy (the “<strong>Policy</strong>”) which explains how personal information about you is collected, used and disclosed by InvestNextDoor Incorporated (“<strong>IND</strong>”) when you visit &nbsp;the website www.investnextdoor.ca (the “<strong>Website</strong>”) and use IND’s products and services (“<strong>IND Services</strong>”). It is IND’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our Website and using IND Services.</p>
        <p><strong>Collecting and Using Personal Information</strong></p>
        <p>Like most website operators, IND collects personal information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. IND’s purpose in collecting this information is to better understand how IND’s visitors use its Website. IND also collects personal information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and visitors commenting on IND profile pages. IND will also want to collect your location information, in order to more easily show you the investment opportunities or investors in your local area. You will receive a request for location information in your browser. To benefit from this, please click “allow”.</p>
        <p>Certain visitors to IND’s Website choose to interact with IND Services in ways that require IND to collect additional personal information. The amount and type of information that IND collects depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for IND Services to provide their full name and email address. Those who engage in transactions with IND or others using the Website and IND Services may be asked to provide additional information, including as necessary, the personal and financial information (such as date of birth, social insurance number, account information, information about employment, assets, income, investment experience, transactions and other information) required to process those IND Services. In each case, IND collects such information only as necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with IND and IND Services. IND does not disclose personal information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personal &nbsp;information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Website-related activities and IND Services.</p>
        <p>Other purposes IND may use your personal information include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>To create your profile and authenticate your ID</li>
        <li>To provide and administer IND Services</li>
        <li>Track usage for quality and test purposes</li>
        <li>Monitor your usage and run random audits to ensure compliance with the Terms and Conditions</li>
        <li>Personalize your experience on the Website</li>
        <li>Detecting and preventing security threats to the Website and the IND Services;</li>
        <li>Helping us develop and market our brand, products, services, promotions and advertising;</li>
        <li>Communicating with you about promotions, special offers, upcoming events, and other news about IND and our selected partners;</li>
        <li>Communicating with you about our IND Services and sending you related information, including confirmations, technical notices, updates, security alerts and support; and</li>
        <li>Other purposes that we identify to you from time-to-time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>IND may collect personal information to create aggregated statistics about the behavior of visitors to its Website. For instance, IND may monitor the most popular pages of the Website.</p>
        <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Disclosure of Personal Information</strong></p>
        <p>IND may transfer personal information to third parties such as subcontractors, suppliers, service providers, contractors or agents (including our affiliates acting in this capacity) that perform services on our behalf such as processing and administering IND Services, processing payment transactions, customer relations, customer service, marketing and promotions, information technology and/or data hosting or processing services or similar services, or otherwise to collect, use, disclose, store or process personal information on our behalf for the purposes described in this Policy.</p>
        <p>Further, IND only discloses personal information to other users of the IND Services with your consent. IND may disclose personal information to: (a) those that you consent or have a need-to-know, such as a business or investor with whom you want to conduct a transaction and (b) to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on IND’s behalf or to execute IND Services available at IND’s Website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.</p>
        <p>IND will not rent, sell or otherwise disclose personal information to anyone unless you consented.&nbsp; IND may disclose personal information in response to a legal obligation, such as a subpoena, court order or other governmental request.</p>
        <p>From time to time, IND may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends and statistics in the usage of its Website.</p>
        <p><strong>Protection of Personal Information</strong></p>
        <p>IND implements reasonable security measures appropriate to the sensitivity of the personal information, to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, loss, or destruction of personal information. These security measures include internal reviews of our personal information collection, storage and processing practices, and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal information.</p>
        <p>If IND uses third party such service providers, IND requires such service providers to use similar security measures to those used by IND, and also requires service providers to limit access to your personal information and to keep it confidential. Service providers are only permitted to use your personal information for the sole purpose of carrying out services on behalf of IND.</p>
        <p>Your personal information may be transferred to third party service providers, or to organizations or investors which you consent to in order to use the IND Services, that may be located in a country outside of Canada. Your personal information may be stored and processed in a country that has laws that are different from Canada, and where the government (e.g.: the United States) may be able to obtain disclosure of your personal information.</p>
        <p><strong>Commercial Electronic Messages</strong></p>
        <p>If you are a registered user of the IND Website and have consented and supplied your email address to receive commercial electronic messages (“CEMs”), IND may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, special offers, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with IND and our products. We primarily use our blog and social media services to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If at any time you decide you no longer want to receive CEMs about special offers, news or other marketing and promotional information from IND or our selected partners, you can opt-out. You can unsubscribe by clicking the unsubscribe button in the email you receive or by emailing us at service@investnextdoor.ca. Please allow 5-7 business days to process your request.</p>
        <p>Please note that IND may still send you non-promotional emails, such as emails about your account, service-related announcements regarding the IND Services or other communications regarding our ongoing business relations.</p>
        <p>If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Email or other communication sent to IND may be retained in order to process your inquiries, to respond to your requests, and to improve IND Services.</p>
        <p><strong>Affiliated sites</strong></p>
        <p>We may offer links to other websites as part of IND Services. IND does not exercise any control over linked sites and does not collect information as a result of your contact with those sites. Personal information that you provide directly to such sites will be controlled by the policies, terms and conditions (if any) governing those sites. IND will not have any liability or responsibility for any interaction you may have or any personal information or information you may provide through such third party linked sites.</p>
        <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
        <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. IND uses cookies to help identify and track visitors, their website access preferences, and their usage of the IND Website, including date and time of visit, pages viewed, amount of time spent on the sites, and general information about the device used to access the site. Cookies are also used for security purposes and to personalize your experience, such as customizing your screen layout. IND visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using the IND Website, with the drawback that certain features of IND’s Website may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
        <p>Some internet browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” features. Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference (the <strong>“DNT Signal</strong>”) to the web sites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not a common understanding of how to interpret DNT Signals nor a common definition of “tracking” and, because, as described below, we do not engage in so-called “retargeting” on third-party websites, we do not currently respond to DNT Signals on the IND Website.</p>
        <p><strong>Business Transfers</strong></p>
        <p>If all or portions of IND were sold or acquired, or in the unlikely event that IND goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information may be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of IND may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this Policy.</p>
        <p><strong>Ads</strong></p>
        <p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This &nbsp;Policy covers the use of cookies by IND and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
        <p><strong>Privacy Policy Changes</strong></p>
        <p>IND may change this Policy from time to time, and in IND’s sole discretion. IND encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its &nbsp;Policy.</p>
        <p><strong>Access</strong></p>
        <p>If you request, we will let you know what personal information IND has about you, what it is being used for, and with whom it has been shared.</p>
        <p>IND will provide you with access to your personal information that is in our possession, subject to certain exceptions, including information that is reference to another individual’s personal information that cannot be severed, or information subject to solicitor-client privilege, or other legal restrictions that may prevent us from fulfilling your request.</p>
        <p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal information please contact us.</p>
